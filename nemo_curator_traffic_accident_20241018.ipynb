        "# Introduction\n",
        "## Traffic Accident Data\n",
        "- The traffic accident data used in this project are downloaded and cleaned from Michigan Traffic Crash Facts website (https://www.michigantrafficcrashfacts.org/legacy/querytool#q1;0;2022;;). This dataset include detailed information about Crash Date, Crash Time, Crash Type, Light, Road Surface Condition, Vehicle Type, and some information about persons involed in the traffic accidents such as Age, Sex, Race, etc. Furthermore, there is a column called \"Narative\" in the dataset which is unstructured nlp data extracted from police accident report.\n",
        "- It would be good to build a ChatBot to analyze the traffic accident data, and answer some interesting questions like:\n",
        "      \"What are the most common traffic accident patterns?\",\n",
        "      \"What is the average age of the drivers involved in the traffic accidents?\",\n",
        "      \"What is the most frequent weather condition when traffic accidents happened?\",\n",
        "      \"What time of day do most accidents occur?\",\n",
        "      \"Which vehicle makes are most frequently involved in accidents?\"\n",
        "- One challenging issue is how to remove personal sensitive information from the traffic accident reports. Sometimes the victim names appear in the Narrative Column.\n",
        "## Project Highlight\n",
        "- I first applied Nvidia nemo-curator to remove any personal sensitive information from the traffic accident data.  \n",
        "- The I created a vector database using llama-index, each row of the dataset is treated as a traffic accident file with Narrative as the mainbody and the other columns as metadata, then I created the chatbot using gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
        "- The results show that Nemo pii_modifier can effectively identify person names in Narrative column and replaced the sensitive information\n",
        "- llamaindex really simplify the pipeline to make a ChatBot up and running\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "- Due to limited capacity, I only randomly sampled 564 traffic accident records from 2022 from the database. In total there are 293341 traffic accidents just in Michigan State based on the description in the website. It would be good to download more data.\n",
        "- We can also improve the prompt used in the chatbot when communicating with the LLMs\n",
        "- We can also try other LLMs except the gpt-3.5-turbo\n"
